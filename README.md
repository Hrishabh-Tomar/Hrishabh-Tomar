# Hi, I'm Hrishabh Singh Tomar 🚀
### Full Stack Data Scientist | MLOps Practitioner | Revenue Strategist

**I don't just train models—I build end-to-end data systems that drive profit.**

[cite_start]With a Master’s in **Business Analytics & AI** [cite: 8] [cite_start]and a strong foundation in **MLOps** and **Predictive Analytics**, I specialize in the full lifecycle of data science. I bridge the gap between engineering and business strategy, turning raw, unstructured data into deployed models and measurable ROI.

[cite_start]I have engineered solutions that processed **350k+ records** [cite: 24] [cite_start]and directly influenced **$180,000+ in revenue**[cite: 5].

### ⚛️ The Full Stack Approach
I operate across the entire stack to deliver production-ready data products:

* [cite_start]**Data Engineering:** Designing ETL pipelines and querying complex SQL databases to prepare datasets of **200k-350k records** for analysis[cite: 21, 24].
* [cite_start]**Data Science:** Building robust regression and classification models using **Python (Scikit-Learn)** to predict user behavior and health indicators[cite: 38, 41].
* [cite_start]**MLOps & Automation:** Developing automated EDA systems that streamline data cleaning and reduce time-to-insight by **40%**.
* [cite_start]**Business Intelligence:** Deploying real-time dashboards in **Tableau** and **Power BI** to visualize A/B test results and KPI tracking[cite: 22, 41].
